## Q: Define game theory

Game theory is a mathematical way to analyze how people make decisions when they are uncertain about the actions of others.
Q: What is the prisoner's dilemma?
A: The prisoner's dilemma is a well-known example of a game with a unique equilibrium. It is a two-player game where the players can either cooperate with each other or defect. The unique equilibrium of the prisoner's dilemma is for both players to defect.
Q: What are the three main results of game theory?
A: The three main results of game theory are the Nash equilibrium, the minimax theorem, and the theory of cooperative games.
Q: What is a Nash equilibrium?
A: A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies for two players in a game. If both players play the strategies in the Nash equilibrium, then they will not be able to do better by changing their strategies.
Q: What is a minimax theorem?
A: A minimax theorem is a theorem that gives the optimal strategies for a player in a zero-sum game.
Q: What is the minimax theorem for a zero-sum game?
A: The minimax theorem for a zero-sum game states that a player should choose their strategy so that the maximum payoff for the opponent is no more than the minimum payoff for the player.
Q: What is the minimax theorem for a non-zero-sum game?
A: The minimax theorem for a non-zero-sum game states that a player should choose their strategy so that the maximum payoff for the opponent is no more than the minimum payoff for the player.
Q: What is the theory of cooperative games?
A: The theory of cooperative games is a theory that states that the best outcome for a group of players in a game is achieved when the players all cooperate.
Q: What are the two main results of cooperative game theory?
A: The two main results of cooperative game theory are the Folk theorem, and the theory of subgame perfect equilibria.
Q: What is the Folk theorem?
A: The Folk theorem states that if a game has a subgame perfect equilibrium, then it also has a Nash equilibrium.
Q: What is the theory of subgame perfect equilibria?
A: The theory of subgame perfect equilibria states that if a game has a subgame perfect equilibrium, then it also has a Nash equilibrium.
Q: What are the two main results of cooperative game theory?
A: The two main results of cooperative game theory are the Folk theorem, and the theory of subgame perfect equilibria.
Q: What is the Folk theorem?
A: The Folk theorem states that if a game has a subgame perfect equilibrium, then it also has a Nash equilibrium.
Q: What is the theory of subgame perfect equilibria?
A: The theory of subgame perfect equilibria states that if a game has a subgame perfect equilibrium, then it also has a Nash equilibrium.
Q: What is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium?
A: A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies for two players in a game. If both players play the strategies in the Nash equilibrium, then they will not be able to do better by changing their strategies.
Q: What is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium?
A: A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies for two players in a game. If both players play the strategies in the Nash equilibrium, then they will not be able to do better by changing their strategies.

A: A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies for two players in a game. If both players play the strategies in the Nash equilibrium, then they will not be able to do better by changing their strategies.
Q: What is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium?
A: A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies for two players in a game. If both players play the strategies in the Nash equilibrium, then they will not be able to do better by changing their strategies.
