## Q: Define Game Theory

Game Theory is a branch of applied mathematics that studies strategic decision making. It is used to predict the outcome of interactions between rational players.
Q: Q: What is the Prisoners Dilemma
A:
A: The Prisoners Dilemma is a classic example of Game Theory. It describes a situation in which two prisoners are separately interrogated. They are each offered the following deal: If one testifies against the other, and the other remains silent, the one who testifies goes free and the other receives a ten year sentence. If both remain silent, they are both sentenced to only one year. If they both testify against each other, they are both sentenced to five years in prison.
Q: Q: What is the Nash Equilibrium
A:
A: The Nash Equilibrium is the solution to a game in Game Theory. It is the state in which no player has anything to gain by changing their strategy.
Q: Q: What is a Repeated Game
A:
A: A Repeated Game is a game in which players repeatedly play against each other. The game may have an end or it may not.
Q: Q: What is an Extensive Form Game
A:
A: An Extensive Form Game is a game in which players move sequentially. These games can be represented by a tree. The first player to move is called the root player. The player who is directly below the root player is called the parent player. The player directly to the left of the parent player is called the left child player. The player directly to the right of the parent player is called the right child player. The player directly below the left child player is called the left grandchild player. The player directly below the right child player is called the right grandchild player.
Q: Q: What is a Normal Form Game
A:
A: A Normal Form Game is a game in which players move simultaneously. These games can be represented by a matrix.
Q: Q: What is a Mixed Strategy
A:
A: A Mixed Strategy is a strategy in which a player does not use the same strategy every time. Instead, the player uses a different strategy with a certain probability.
Q: Q: What is a Pure Strategy
A:
A: A Pure Strategy is a strategy in which a player always uses the same strategy.
Q: Q: What is a Dominant Strategy
A:
A: A Dominant Strategy is a strategy that is better than all of the other strategies available to a player.
Q: Q: What is a Nash Equilibrium
A:
A: A Nash Equilibrium is the solution to a game in Game Theory. It is the state in which no player has anything to gain by changing their strategy.
Q: Q: What is a Pareto Optimal
A:
A: A Pareto Optimal is a situation in which no player can be made better off without making at least one other player worse off.
Q: Q: What is a Zero Sum Game
A:
A: A Zero Sum Game is a game in which the total value of the payoffs for all players is zero.
Q: Q: What is a Stackelberg Game
A:
A: A Stackelberg Game is a game in which a leader makes decisions first, and a follower responds to the leader's decisions.
Q: Q: What is a Cournot Duopoly
A:
A: A Cournot Duopoly is a market with two sellers. The market is in equilibrium when both sellers are producing a quantity such that the market price is equal to the marginal cost of production.
Q: Q: What is a Bertrand Duopoly
A:
A: A Bertrand Duopoly is a market with two sellers. The market is in equilibrium when both sellers are producing a quantity such that the market price is equal to the marginal cost of production.
Q: Q: What is a Stackelberg Duopoly
A:
A: A Stackelberg Duopoly is a market with two sellers. The market is in equilibrium when both sellers are producing a quantity such that the market price is equal to the marginal cost of production.
Q: Q: What is a Cournot Oligopoly
A:
A: A Cournot Oligopoly is a market with a large number of sellers. The market is in equilibrium when the quantity produced is such that the market price is equal to the marginal cost of production.
Q: Q: What is a Bertrand Oligopoly
A:
A: A Bertrand Oligopoly is a market with a large number of sellers. The market is in equilibrium when the quantity produced is such that the market price is equal to the marginal cost of production.
Q: Q: What is a Stackelberg Oligopoly
A:
A: A Stackelberg Oligopoly
